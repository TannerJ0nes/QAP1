  <center><h1>History of the Computer</h1></center>  
  <hr />
  <h2>In The Beginning ...</h2>
  <p>The history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago, with the birth of the abacus.
     When the beads on the abacus are moved around, according to programming rules memorized by the user, 
     all regular arithmetic problems can be done. In 1671, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz invented a computer 
     that was built in 1694. It could add, and, after changing some things around, multiply. About a century 
     later Thomas of Colmar created the first successful mechanical calculator that could add, subtract, multiply, and divide.</p>

     <h2>Other Memorable Events ...</h2>
     <ul><li>In 1812, Babbage realized that many long calculations were really a series of predictable actions that were
         constantly repeated. He began to design an automatic mechanical calculating machine, which he called a difference
          engine.</li>
          <br>
        <li>Herman Hollerith and James Powers made a step towards automated computing with the development of punched cards. 
            Reading errors were reduced dramatically, workflow increased, and stacks of punched cards could be used as memory 
            of almost unlimited size. For more than 50 years, punched card machines did most of the world's first business 
            computing.</li>
            <br>
        <li>The start of World War II produced a large need for computer capacity. In 1942, John P. Eckert and 
            John W. Mauchly decided to build a high - speed electronic computer to do the job. Known as ENIAC, 
            this machine could multiply two numbers at a rate of 300 per second.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Early in the 50's two important engineering discoveries changed the image of the computer field - 
            Magnetic Core Memory and Transistor - Circuit Elements. These technical discoveries quickly found 
            their way into computers. Such computers were mostly found in large computer centers operated by industry, 
            government, and private laboratories.</li>
            <br>
        <li>In the 1960's, efforts to design and develop the fastest possible computer with the greatest capacity reached 
            a turning point with the Stretch computer by IBM. Stretch was made with the fastest access time, and total 
            capacity in the vicinity of 100,000,000 words.</li>
            <br>

        <li>Many companies, some new to the computer field, introduced programmable minicomputers supplied with software 
            packages in the 1970’s. The "shrinking" trend continued with the introduction of personal computers (PC's), 
            which are programmable machines small enough and inexpensive enough to be purchased and used by individuals. 
            Many companies, such as Apple Computer and Radio Shack introduced very successful PCs in the 1970’s.</li> 
            <br>
        <li>By the late 1980’s, some personal computers were run by microprocessors that, handling 32 bits of data at a time,
             could process about 4,000,000 instructions per second.</li>
             <br>
        <li>Computer networking, e-mail and the Internet, and electronic publishing are just a few of the applications that 
            have grown in recent years. Computers continue to decrease in price, offering the promise that soon, 
            “computers will reside in most homes, offices, and schools”.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Great Computer Quotes ...</h2>
    <center><p>“Men are form Mars, Women are from Venus, Computers are from Hell.” <br> ~Author Unknown </p></center>
    <center><p>“Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; <br>
        teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.”

    <center><p>“To err is human, but to really foul things up requires a computer.” <br>~Farmer's Almanac, 1972</p></center>
    <h2>The Generations Of Computers </h2>

    <ol><li><b>1st Generation:</b>The first generation of computers ran from 1940 to 1955. It brought about the beginnnings
    of machine language. They used magnetic drums and vaccum tubes for circuitry and main memory. They took up large amounts
    space and often overheated. Inputs were based on punch cards and paper tape, outputs were displayed on printouts.
    This generation brought on the Von Neumann architecture.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>2nd Generation:</b>Ran From 1957-1963. This is the generation where they transisoned from Vaccum tubs to transistors.
         COBOL and FORTRAN were made as assembly & programming languages. Computers begin to get smalled in this stage
        They advance from binary to assembly languages.</li>
        <br>
    <li><b>3rd Generation:</b>From 1964-1971. This was the period where the integrated circuit was designed. These
     Computers were quicker, again smaller, more reliable, and much less expensive.</li>
     <br>
    <li><b>4th Generation:</b> 1971-1980 was the forthgeneration of computers. It was here the microprocessors were invented 
        C, C++ and JAva were utilized in this generation as programming languages</li>
        <br>
    <li><b>5th Generation:</b> This Generation has been in use since 1980. This is the current and future of the world of computing.
    The main aspect for this generation is artificial intelligence. The use of things such as parallel processing and superconductors
are making this a possability.</li></ol>

<h4>A brief Summary</h4>
<p>Each generation has added different aspects and advances in speed and the power to do multiple tasks at once. All These 
    different advances has lead to the computers we know today and that are used to create webpages, watch videos, etc. As time
    goes on more and more advances will be made and thus a new generation of technology will be made in the short but fast
    changing <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/" target="_blank">timeline</a> of computers
</p>

<h4>Famous Quote</h4>

<center><p>“The advance of technology is based on making it fit in so that you don't really even notice it,<br> so it's part of everyday life.”<br>~Bill Gates, Co-founder of Microsoft. </p></center>

<h4>Extra Feature</h4>
<p>The two Extra Features I added in this webpage, was a link at the bottom to go to the top of the page. and turned the word
    timeline in the final paragraph to a link that sends you to a website in a new tab that has a interactive timeline that
    goes into detail on the history of computers over the years. </p>
